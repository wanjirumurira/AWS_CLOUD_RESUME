# AWS CLOUD RESUME

This project involves hosting a static website in an S3 bucket via Amazon CloudFront distribution. The static website is then connected to a Lambda function through AWS API Gateway. Whenever a user accesses the static website hosted on S3, the Lambda function is triggered, and it writes the count of website visits to a DynamoDB table.
